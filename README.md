# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm âœ¨ Nikola Ninov âœ¨

**`Digital Craftsman (Junior JavaScript/react js/angular)`**

I'm washed up gamer and former electrician, who decided to change his life and become a developer to organize and use his acquired skills in that to solve problems around electrical excavators, cyclic production lines and high voltage lines. I just finished my studies in Telerik Academy with JavaScript and React js. I have hobby to build smart home devices with different controllers and sensors (mostly arduino and raspberry pi). I'm looking for a job as junior developer to start my career in the field of web development.
