Hey there! 👋 I'm a washed-up gamer and former electrician who embarked on an exciting journey to become a developer. My goal is to leverage my unique background and skills to tackle challenges in the world of electrical excavators, cyclic production lines, and high voltage systems. I recently completed my studies in **Telerik Academy** with a focus on JavaScript and React.js.
